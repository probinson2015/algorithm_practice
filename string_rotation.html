<!-- Assume you  have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check is s2 is a rotation os s1 using only one call to isSubstring waterbottle is a rotation of erbottlewat-->
<script>

var s1 = "waterbottle";
var s2 = "erbottlewat";


function isRotation(s1, s2){

	if (s1.length > 0 && s1.length == s2.length){
		//concat s1 and s1 
		var s1s1 = s1+s1;
		//if the word is doubled you should be able to find s2
		if (s1s1.indexOf(s2) > 1){
